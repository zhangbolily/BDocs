## Reference

### `BTiming() noexcept`
Construct a BTiming object.

### `~BTiming()`
Destruct a BTiming object.

### `void start()`
Start recording real time. Takes no effects if startCPUTiming is called.

### `void stop()`
Stop recording real time. Takes no effects if startCPUTiming is called.

### `void startCPUTiming()`
Start recording CPU time. Takes no effects if start is called.

### `void stopCPUTiming()`
Stop recording CPU time. Takes no effects if start is called.

### `bool isActive()`
Returns true if timing.

### `int64 time() const`
Returns the real time recorded by calling start and stop in
 microseconds; otherwise returns 0.

### `int64 CPUTime() const`
Returns the CPU time recorded by calling startCPUTiming and
 stopCPUTiming in microseconds; otherwise returns 0.
